            <h3>Smart Escalator Controlling Using PLN and IoT ESP32</h3>
            <p class="align-justify">This device is a development of an induction motor control system using a PLC in Escalator applications. The development carried out is by adding a monitoring device using an ESP32 microcontroller which is integrated into the Internet and Website. This monitoring device can detect when the phase voltage is lost and a voltage abnormality occurs (the voltage is too high or too low) at the input of the 3 phase induction motor. The microcontroller will automatically stop the motor when an abnormality is found in the 3 phase input and will be recorded on the monitoring website.</p>

The courier who arrives only needs to enter the receipt number into the box via the keypad provided. If the receipt number entered is correct, the door will open automatically and the courier only needs to put the package in the box. After the package is placed in the box, the owner will receive a notification via the Telegram chatbot.</p>
